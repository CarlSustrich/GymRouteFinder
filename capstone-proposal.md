# Capstone Proposal

Carl Sustrich

Gym Route Finder (will be renamed)

## Project Purpose

This project will serve to serve as a 'guidebook' for rock climbing gyms. When a climber ventures outdoors, they bring a guidebook along, that describes defined routes, including difficulty, gear required and descriptions. However, when training in a gym, a climber must resort to wandering the facility searching for routes that fit the difficulty and style they are looking for. Routes change frequently in most gyms, so this time spent can add up, and becomes increasingly frustrating as the facility becomes more crowded. I envision this app replicating a guidebook. Users will be able to view a map of the gym, and interact with routes added by gym staff.

## MVP for this project

As an MVP for the timeframe available in class, I would like to see a user be able to open the app, select at least a single gym, and view available routes. As an MVP, I will use seeded date for this. I am only aiming to make this app compatible with an android environment. IOS will not be supported.

## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources

* React & React Native
* Typescript
* Expo / ExpoGo
* React Navigation

## Further Exploration Features

With additional time, I have a variety of ideas to include. Which I add will depend on availability of time. These include:

* Authorization, potentially using google/facebook login
  * Separate roles, for gym staff and users
* QR code utility, scan to be taken directly to a gym
* Utilizing a database for data permanence
  * Ability for staff login roles to create/ remove routes
* Actually deploy app to Play store???

## Additional tools required to add further exploration features

* OAuth2 | OpenID
* [This](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-qrcode-scanner) QR scanner dependency
* Firebase? NoSQL?
* EAS (Expo Application Services)

## Other Info

I am considering a primary point of this project to simply be familiarizing myself with React Native and Typescript. Anything on top of that is bonus. Hence the low MVP. ðŸ™‚
