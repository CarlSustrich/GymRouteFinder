# Gym Route Finder

Carl Sustrich

## Purpose

This project will serve to serve as a 'guidebook' for rock climbing gyms. When a climber ventures outdoors, they bring a guidebook along, that describes defined routes, including difficulty, gear required and descriptions. However, when training in a gym, a climber must resort to wandering the facility searching for routes that fit the difficulty and style they are looking for. Routes change frequently in most gyms, so this time spent can add up, and becomes increasingly frustrating as the facility becomes more crowded. I envision this app replicating a guidebook. Users will be able to view a map of the gym, and interact with routes added by gym staff.
